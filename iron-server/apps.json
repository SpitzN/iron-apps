Bist Du in Deutschland oder einem anderen Land in Europa unterwegs, kannst Du dir das Wetter nicht nur für den Tag anschauen, sondern auch stundengenau. Das heißt, Du weißt ganz genau wann Du einen Schirm einpacken solltest, weil es mittags regnet oder ob Du dir lieber ein Eis in der Sonne gönnen kannst. Falls dir das Wetter in Europa nicht reicht, weil Du die Welt bereist, kannst Du dir das Wetter schon in der 15-Tage-Vorschau ansehen und planen, was Du alles einpacken musst. <br><br>☀ <b>Mehr Wetterinfos auf einen Blick</b> ☀<br>Wir haben nicht nur klassische Wetterdaten, wie die Temperatur, sondern auch viele weitere Infos, die das Wetter betreffen: gefühlte Temperatur, Luftfeuchtigkeit, Windstärke und Windrichtung.

Explorer provides turn-by-turn directions from any location, from the edge of the universe to the age of the dinosaurs, plus the shortest route to restrooms, shops, cafes, and exits.<br><br>How does Explorer know where you are? The Museum has placed more than 700 Bluetooth beacons throughout its 45 permanent halls. These tiny beacons give off signals that your phone can detect (when Bluetooth is enabled). Your phone calculates your position based on detecting three of these beacons simultaneously. This triangulation is not always perfect, especially in certain areas like large, multi-level halls, meandering walkways, or stairwells. Your phone should be able to detect the hall that you are in and provide turn-by-turn directions, but sometimes the “blue dot” is not exactly in the right place. In some rare cases it will even be missing. Moving to another area and waiting a few moments will usually fix the issue.<br><br>The Museum’s free AMNH-Guest Wi-Fi also varies in strength throughout the complex. Certain materials and large exhibits (i.e. the Blue Whale) either absorb or reflect the radio signals used by Wi-Fi, further complicating this technology. If you experience difficulty connecting to Wi-Fi in a particular part of the Museum, you can usually fix the issue by moving a short distance away.<br><br>NOTE: Bluetooth must be turned on for full functionality. Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.<br><br>Let us know how the app is working and how we can improve your Museum experience by sending us your feedback to explorer@amnh.org<br><br>*Supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies</div>",

You can participate in as many servers as you like!<br><br>* Instant invite links for chat servers<br><br>Inviting friends to talk is as simple as copy/pasting a link. Once your teammates open your unique server link, they’ll instantly be added to your voice or text chat group so you can immediately start playing games, organizing World of Warcraft raids, and trash talking your Rocket League buddies.<br><br>* Server tools and member roles<br><br>Discord is full of tools to help you organize your guilds however you like.

You can also sort specific clan members into groups that you can message all at once with a single tag.<br><br>* Community management<br><br>Groups of all sizes thrive on Discord. In fact, we’re the preferred communication app of game developers, Reddit communities, Twitch streamers, YouTube content creators, and countless other gaming-related interest groups to post news, polls, giveaways, and discussion topics for their thousands of followers.<br><br>* Push notification controls<br><br>Want to be notified when someone DMs or tags you to play Overwatch, but not when there’s a big debate about theorycrafting in your MTG Arena group? That’s easy with our detailed server notification settings, which give you complete control over what types of messages you get alerted for.<br><br>* Cross-platform app for AFK chatting<br><br>Discord is available for both mobile and desktop so you can voice chat with your team while playing games like PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, or Destiny 2 on your PC, and continue to meme with the whole squad on your phone when you’re out playing Pokemon Go. Have all the flexibility you need in an app that’s fun, sleek, and easy to use.<br><br>Millions of Discord servers have been created so far, with rich communities and tight-knit guilds formed around numerous games and interests.
